Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the 
concept of objects, which are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint that 
defines the properties and methods of an object, and an object is a specific 
instance of that class.

One of the key principles of OOP is encapsulation, which means that the data and 
behavior of an object are contained within that object and are not accessible to other 
objects except through the object's public interface. This helps to keep the code 
organized and modular, and makes it easier to maintain and modify.

The statement you provided is highlighting one of the benefits of encapsulation.
By encapsulating the data and behavior of an object within that object, we can 
eliminate the need to depend on global data. Global data is data that is accessible 
from anywhere in the program, and can be modified by any part of the program. This 
can lead to issues with code complexity and maintainability, since changes to 
global data can have unexpected effects on other parts of the program.

In an object-oriented programming approach, each object has its own data and behavior, 
and those are not accessible from other parts of the program except through the object's
public interface. This means that changes to an object's data or behavior only affect 
that object, and not other parts of the program. This makes it easier to reason about 
the behavior of the program, and to make changes without unintended consequences.

In summary, the oriented object programming approach allows the data and code of an 
object to be at the same level, eliminating the need to depend on global data. 
Encapsulation helps to keep the code organized and modular, and makes it easier to 
maintain and modify.
