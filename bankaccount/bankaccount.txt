Encapsulation

Refers the idea of hiding data and implementation details within an object and
only exposing the necessary information to the outside world through well - 
defined interfaces.

Encapsulation allow us to protect the internal state of an object from being
modified directly by other code, which helps to improve code reliability and
maintainability.

As example, there is the class BankAccount:

Instance attributes: 
    >>>_balance

Methods: 
    >>> deposit  : enforce constraints in _balance
    >>> withdraw : enforce constraints in _balance

    >>> get_balance - return the value of the attribute _balance, this method
    provide a read-only interface to the user.

    >>> using @property decorator, allow us access the 
    _balance attribute as a property instead of directly
    access the _balance attribute. This improve the 
    overall readability of the code and provides more
    control over how the attribute is accessed and used.
